# Who am I?
[[Joe Germany]]

# Research Interests
I am currently interested and working on a project in physics-informed machine learning related to data-driven discovery of the Hamiltonian expression of a dynamical system.

Some related webpages which I hope to develop:
- [[Physics-Informed Machine Learning]]
- [[Dimensionally Consistent Learning]]
