# Who am I?
I am Joe Germany, a first-year university student at the American University of Beirut, double majoring in Pure Mathematics and Physics.
# Research Interests
I am currently interested and working on a number of projects in the field of physics-informed machine learning with a special focus on Hamiltonian mechanics. Supervised by Dr. Sara Najem and Dr. Joseph Bakarji, I am working on creating data-driven techniques for the discovery of the Hamiltonian expression of a dynamical systems and for its predicting its temporal evolution, while preserving symplecticity.
You can find the website of our research lab (Data-Driven Modeling Lab) at: [Data-Driven Modeling Lab - Joseph Bakarji](https://www.josephbakarji.com/data-driven-modeling-lab)

I am also in the process of writing up an interactive survey (being progressively published on this website) on the field of physics-informed machine learning with particular focus on techniques for the treatment of Hamiltonian systems. You can find it here: [[Survey on the Techniques of Physics-Informed Machine Learning]].
