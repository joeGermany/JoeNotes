I am Joe Germany, a second-year student at the American University of Beirut, double majoring in Mathematics and Physics.

# Research Interests
I am interested at the intersections between machine learning and physics, in the development of architectures to more accurately learn the phase space trajectories of Hamiltonian systems, but also on the rigorous analysis of neural network-based solvers for partial differential equations.

I am working with [Joseph Bakarji](https://www.josephbakarji.com/) and [Sara Najem](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SqWOv0cAAAAJ&hl=en) on developing data-driven techniques for the Hamiltonian systems that respect their underlying geometric properties, in particular symplecticity. We are also exploring how to discover unit-consistent expressions for Hamiltonians directly from data.

With [Elie Abdo](https://sites.google.com/view/elie-abdo-website/) and other collaborators, I work on the analysis of nonlinear and nonlocal partial differential equations that describe the interactions of charged particles with fluids across various physical settings. Our work addresses questions of well-posedness and long-time behavior of solutions. We also study the approximation theory of physics-informed neural networks and how such neural network approximations can be used to rigorously infer properties of the true PDE solutions.
