This survey, in the format of an interactive zettelkasten-type vault, will constitute a survey of the techniques in the literature on physics-informed machine learning with a focus on dynamical systems and the Hamiltonian formalism. The main pages are:
- [[Solving Differential Equations using Neural Networks]]
- [[Traditional Methods for solving Hamiltonian Systems]]
- [[Hamiltonian Neural Networks and related architectures]]
- [[SympNet and other symplectic, structure-preserving networks]]
- [[Other architectures]]

Below are a few, additional ideas that are pertinent to my research: 
- [[Dimension-Preserving Networks and BuckiNet]]
- [[Symbolic Hamiltonian Regression Methods]]
