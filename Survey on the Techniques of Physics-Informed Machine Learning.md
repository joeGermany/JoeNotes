This survey, in the format of an interactive Obsidian vault, will constitute a survey of the techniques in the literature on physics-informed machine learning with a focus on dynamical systems and the Hamiltonian formalism, including the following main points:
- [[Solving Differential Equations using Neural Networks]]
- [[Traditional Methods for solving Hamiltonian Systems]]
- [[Hamiltonian Neural Networks and related architectures]]
- [[SympNet and symplectic, structure-preserving networks]]

Below are a few, additional that are pertinent to my research: 
- [[Dimension-Preserving Networks and BuckiNet]]
- [[Symbolic Hamiltonian Regression Methods]]
- [[Neural Networks based on Techniques from Classical Mechanics]]
